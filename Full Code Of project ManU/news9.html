<strong>Q&A: DALEY BLIND DISCUSSES HIS FIRST YEAR AT UNITED, MEMPHIS AND PLAYING AT CENTRE-BACK</strong>



Central defence, full-back or midfield - Daley Blind is willing and able to play wherever he is needed, as the Dutchman has shown during his promising first year with Manchester United.
</br>
Blind, who signed from Ajax last summer, has particularly excelled in recent weeks as part of a United backline that has kept three clean sheets in as many Barclays Premier League matches thus far. 
</br>
Daley gave an in-depth and exclusive interview to United Review, the official matchday programme at Old Trafford for Saturday's goalless draw with Newcastle, in which he reflected on his first year as a Red, the arrivals of fellow countryman Memphis Depay and his new role as a left-sided centre-back...
</br></br>
<b>Daley, first of all, how do you assess our start to the season?</b></br>
Yes we’re happy. Pre-season was very good and very well organised, we all stayed fit and played some good matches, and we have started the season very well. We need to keep that going.
</br></br><b>
You mention the team had a good pre-season – just how important was it for everyone in the squad to get a good preparation period under your belts?</b></br>
It’s always nice to go away for a period of time together, train hard for a week or two and play some good matches. We were a great group already but with the tour I think it helped us become even stronger and you could see the consistency we took from it in the opening couple of league matches.
</br></br><b>
People have said it’ll take the team time to gel with new players coming in – how do you feel things are coming along?</b></br>
Things have been going well. The new signings have fitted in really quickly. Everyone is helping them and I think they feel very comfortable at the club now which is nice to see. If you look at the performances they have been good and you have seen how the new guys have adapted and fitted in to the squad. We have to keep building on that.
</br></br><b>
Your fellow countryman Memphis Depay joined during the summer - how he’s taken to life here and what does he bring?</b></br>
He’s settled in very well. You can see he has a lot of talent, he’s very strong and quick and a real personality. He dares to show himself which is very positive and he’s a really good guy who gets along with everyone.
</br></br><b>
You know what it’s like to come here with big expectations on your shoulders – what advice would you give him?</b></br>
Just to enjoy it as much as you can. Of course you’re focused on giving the best performance you can every day in training and in matches, but it’s important not to put yourself under too much pressure and make sure you enjoy moments like when you play at Old Trafford for example. I’m also not sure he needs my advice as he is a real personality! [Laughs] He knows what he can do and has a lot of faith in himself and that’s a good way to be at a club like United.
</br></br><b>
The pair of you are two of a number of Dutch stars playing in the Premier League now…</b></br>
Yes and I think it’s good for the Dutch team and Dutch football. There are a lot of talented young players who have come over to the Premier League which is very good for us.
</br></br><b>
You’ve begun the season in central defence and picked up the Man of the Match award in the win at Villa - how pleasing was that?</b></br>
Of course it’s always nice to get a prize like that for a game. It gives you confidence and it’s nice that people can see you’re doing well there.
</br></br><b>
What’s the biggest thing you have to be aware of when you’re in central defence compared to when you play at full-back or midfield?</b></br>
Every position has its own tasks. You have to know what you need to do in every position and the different situations you must deal with. I have played in this position for the last few games and I can adapt very quickly. I’m just focused on doing my best for the team and becoming Man of the Match against Villa was also a sign for me that I’m doing well. So I can keep looking forward.
</br></br><b>
This is your second season here – what’s the biggest thing you’ve learnt about life at United in the last year?</b></br>
That’s a difficult question! The thing I learnt is also something I always saw from the beginning which is just how big Manchester United is. You see that when you go on tour and at the away games with the amount of supporters we have and how loud they are, it’s incredible. I have never seen anything like it in my life.
</br></br><b>
Do you have a different mind-set going into your second season because you know what’s required here and have you set yourself any targets this season?</b></br>
Yes definitely because you know what to expect more in the games, at the stadiums and from the fans. I think that will be good for me and I want to build on last season, but I’m a guy who lives day-by-day and match-by-match. I want to stay fit and keep improving, and I hope I can play a lot of games and help the team wherever I am needed. That’s the most important thing.
