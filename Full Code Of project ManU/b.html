It appeared that Van Gaal's magic touch had disappeared and after a short, unsuccessful return to Barcelona, the enigmatic coach left his post as Ajax's technical director in 2004 due to an internal conflict.
But the challenge Van Gaal urgently needed to prove himself came in 2005 when he was tasked with breaking the Eredivisie duopoly of Ajax and PSV Eindhoven as coach of AZ Alkmaar. His first two seasons saw AZ narrowly miss out on the title and his mission seemed destined for failure when they finished a lowly 11th in 2007-08. Despite initially announcing his intention to resign, Van Gaal was persuaded to allow the players a chance to redeem themselves and in the following season, AZ lifted the Dutch title for only the second time in the club's history.
The chance to win a championship in a third country tempted Van Gaal to take the reins at Bayern Munich in 2009 and he became the first Dutch manager to win the Bundesliga, in his maiden season. A 3-0 win over Werder Bremen added a DFB-Pokal triumph but van Gaal was denied an extraordinary Treble as he tasted defeat to Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League final.
Although a disappointing 2010-11 season ended with Van Gaal's sacking, the Dutch manager had undoubtedly proved his qualities across Europe and after Netherlands lost all three of their Euro 2012 matches, he was given a chance to restore his international pedigree with a second spell in charge of the Oranje, replacing Bert van Marwijk.
He did not disappoint and Netherlands qualified for the 2014 World Cup with relative ease -- though they needed a desperate late comeback to salvage a draw against lowly Estonia -- boasting nine wins and one draw, with a goal difference of +29. Van Gaal set the national side a target of reaching the semifinals in Brazil and despite many suggesting he would do well to get out of a group containing Chile and Spain with what was regarded as a much weaker side than competed at 2010, he took them all the way to the last four before suffering an agonising penalty shootout defeat to Argentina. 
Brazil were beaten in the third-place playoff and Van Gaal bowed out with his reputation with the national team restored. Just before the World Cup began, Van Gaal had booked his next managerial appointment -- perhaps the greatest challenge of his career comes as manager of a Manchester United side looking to return to former glories. 
Strengths: A born leader with an insatiable desire to win, Van Gaal is an advocate of attractive attacking football, a style which Pep Guardiola insists "we should all aspire to accomplish". An astute tactician, Van Gaal is well known for his ability to develop young players and his disciplinarian approach allows him to command respect in the dressing room.
Weaknesses: A man who is not afraid to air his views or compromise his principles, Van Gaal has sometimes proved an unpopular figure amongst fans and the media. He likes to rotate his sides and this has been known to occasionally backfire on him in the past.
Career High: In 1994-95, his Ajax side went the entire league and Champions League season unbeaten, and is thus considered one of the finest to have graced Europe.
Career Low: After Netherlands had finished as semifinalists in the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championship, Van Gaal led the Oranje to third place in their 2002 World Cup qualifying group -- behind Portugal and Republic of Ireland -- meaning Netherlands missed out on a major finals berth for the first time in 16 years.
Tactics: Van Gaal is prepared to juggle his formation in accordance with the players at his disposal. He tends to favour wider formations however and forces his teams to press high up the pitch, dominate possession and also be clinical on the counter attack.
Quotes: "A system depends on the players you have. I played 4-3-3 with Ajax, 2-3-2-3 with Barcelona and a 4-4-2 with AZ. I'm flexible. The philosophy stays the same though. I don't think that you can adapt it to every possible situation. You need the right mindset, and it depends on how the players see the coach and vice versa. The coach is the focal point of the team but you need to have an open mind, and so do all the players. Everyone needs to work together to achieve a common goal." Van Gaal discusses his philosophy in 2008.
Trivia: Van Gaal is a fully qualified gymnastics teacher.
