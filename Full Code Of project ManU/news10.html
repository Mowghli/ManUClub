<strong>STRENGTH WORK HAS BOOSTED JANUZAJ</strong>

</br>
Manchester United attacker Adnan Januzaj says extra work in the gym has helped him make a positive start to the 2015/16 campaign.
</br>
After bursting onto the scene the season before last, first-team opportunities were not as easy to come by last term in Louis van Gaal's opening year at the helm.
</br>
Januzaj began his senior United career by impressing on the wing, but van Gaal trialled him in a forward position during the Tour 2015 match against Barcelona, which resulted in a 3-1 win for the Reds and a goal from the Belgium international. It was a similar story at Villa Park last Friday when he repeated the feat and he caught the eye again in the no.10 role during the Champions League victory over Club Brugge on Tuesday evening.
</br>
Januzaj is satisfied with his start to the campaign and believes the time he has spent working on his body strength has been very beneficial.
</br>
“I’m working hard on the pitch and off the pitch as well as in the gym to work on my body,” he told MUTV. “I have always been more of a technical player, trying to find spaces to create something with the ball. But working hard in the gym gives you the plus of being stronger and more able to push people off the ball.
</br>
“I have started to get back to my fitness but I still need more rhythm to become even better.
</br>
“The Villa goal was important to me. It was my first game of the season and I was happy to score. You’re always happy when you score a goal for such a big club. And a winning goal! [Smiles]
</br>
“It was good to be involved against Brugge as well. It was a Champions League game so you gain more experience as well at that level.”
</br>
As for his targets for the remainder of the season, the 20-year-old added: “Hopefully I can play more games and get my fitness to the top level. I’m going to work hard to stay in the team and come back to my best.
</br>
“I want to improve more and that’s why I’m training hard. Hopefully I can score more goals. My objective this season is to score more and give more assists.”</br>
