It appeared that Van Gaal's magic touch had disappeared and after a short, unsuccessful return to Barcelona, the enigmatic coach left his post as Ajax's technical director in 2004 due to an internal conflict.
But the challenge Van Gaal urgently needed to prove himself came in 2005 when he was tasked with breaking the Eredivisie duopoly of Ajax and PSV Eindhoven as coach of AZ Alkmaar. His first two seasons saw AZ narrowly miss out on the title and his mission seemed destined for failure when they finished a lowly 11th in 2007-08. Despite initially announcing his intention to resign, Van Gaal was persuaded to allow the players a chance to redeem themselves and in the following season, AZ lifted the Dutch title for only the second time in the club's history.
The chance to win a championship in a third country tempted Van Gaal to take the reins at Bayern Munich in 2009 and he became the first Dutch manager to win the Bundesliga, in his maiden season. A 3-0 win over Werder Bremen added a DFB-Pokal triumph but van Gaal was denied an extraordinary Treble as he tasted defeat to Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League final.
Although a disappointing 2010-11 season ended with Van Gaal's sacking, the Dutch manager had undoubtedly proved his qualities across Europe and after Netherlands lost all three of their Euro 2012 matches, he was given a chance to restore his international pedigree with a second spell in charge of the Oranje, replacing Bert van Marwijk.
He did not disappoint and Netherlands qualified for the 2014 World Cup with relative ease -- though they needed a desperate late comeback to salvage a draw against lowly Estonia -- boasting nine wins and one draw, with a goal difference of +29. Van Gaal set the national side a target of reaching the semifinals in Brazil and despite many suggesting he would do well to get out of a group containing Chile and Spain with what was regarded as a much weaker side than competed at 2010, he took them all the way to the last four before suffering an agonising penalty shootout defeat to Argentina. 
Brazil were beaten in the third-place playoff and Van Gaal bowed out with his reputation with the national team restored. Just before the World Cup began, Van Gaal had booked his next managerial appointment -- perhaps the greatest challenge of his career comes as manager of a Manchester United side looking to return to former glories.
